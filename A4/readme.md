**THE CODE WAS TESTED USING WSL**

# TO COMPILE AND INSTALL ON WSL:
run *sudo make <filename>-install*
**Note**: do not include the file extension
question 1:  sudo make A4Q1-install

*NOTE: the fan might take a second to pick up speed (for smaller error rates, the duty_cycle does not increase as rapidly)*
