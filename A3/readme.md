**THE CODE WAS TESTED USING WSL**

# TO COMPILE AND INSTALL ON WSL:
run *sudo make <filename>-install*
**Note**: do not include the file extension
question 1:  sudo make A3Q1-install

## NOTES ABOUT SUBMITTED SOLUTION:
The solution submitted doesnt have the receive portion working as i could not figure out some crutial peices for the implementation in time.

*The idea I would have implemented* is read the input on pe7 and store what that coresponding input represents, once the end bit is seen, display the bits received.
